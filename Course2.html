                <h2>Key Benefits</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="pbox">
                <li> <p2>With regular money, the power is completely held by single entities like the government, and with so much power, corruptions tends to take over, which is exactly where cryptocurrency aims to resolve, done through their decentralized system. The idea of absolute power is eliminated as it's distributed amongst all members of the network, and is the core purpose of blockchain technology.</p2></li>   
 
            <li> <p2>  Again, with traditional cash, all your bank accounts are fully in control by the central banks and governments, who are able to freeze and deny access to all funds in an instant. Examples such as the Indian 2016 banknote demonetisation as well as the United States having the right to all your assets if you pass away without a legal will go to show how important it is for only you to have access of your funds like in cryptocurrency. </p2></li>

    <li> <p2>  The unbanked are a large population of the world that have no access, or limitited access to banks, making life very difficult for them. Cryptocurrency acts as a solution to this world wide conflict as anyone with a phone can make payments and transfers. It's fair to say more people have phones than banks to work with which is exactly how cryptocurrency serves the unbanked and makes life much easier for them.</p2> </li> 

     <li><p2> Central banks are able to print money whenever they want, and mainly do it when they're suffering an economical conflict, which is a process known as quantitative easing. However what this does is devalue the currency to a point where the people can't afford daily necessities. Cryptocurrencies are better in this case as they have a limited, and set amount of coins available to buy, sell, and mine, and there's no way to simply create more coins.</p2></li> 
      

                
          <li> <p2>  The middleman are always there when it comes to the regular currency. Additional charges and small cuts are taken from these banks and digital services when external transfers are made. Whereas with cryptocurrency, any transfer involves only the reciever and the sender, meaning the middleman no longer exists in this blockchain technology and saves one a lot of money. </p2></li>

        <h2>Large Risks</h2>
        </div>
            <div class="pbox">
     <li><p1>The volatility of cryptocurrency is easily the greatest risk in investing, holding or selling these coins. The main reason for these  flucations of crypto's value is that it's influenced by several unpredictable factors(government rules, media portrayal, etc) that all come under supply and demand. For example, if a famous news reporter talks positively about crypto and recommends investing in coins like bitcoin, the demand for bitcoin will severely increase, along with it's value and if huge companies like Tesla say they will never accept bitcoin, the demand for bitcoin will definitely decrease, along with it's value. Being a new concept to investors and spectators is another reason why it can be difficult to predict exactly when the value rises or falls. A series of unpredictable factors serves as a huge risk to crypto owners, however as humankind better understands cryptocurrency, the volatility will get much easier to predict.</p1></li><br>

                </div>
                <br>
            
     <li><p1> One of the most important features of cryptocurrency is it's secrecy, as in it's encryption and anonymous user system, as well as it's decentralization. While this may have it's great benefits and advantages when compared with traditonal money, it also creates a threatening and worldwide risk by opening the possibilities of cybercrime. Being decentralized means crypto transactions are not closely monitored as they would be under a government's power, allowing several oppurtunites for cybercrimes. Commiting money laundering and stealing funds are seriously simplified through the anonymousity of cryptocurrency, and has been done multiple times before, such as the dirty money laundering of billions of dollars in 2018. Like everything in our world, with good, comes bad. </p1></li>
